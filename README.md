Processing Template Engine
==========================

#### Description 
That project is created to prevent writing `spaggety code` during `Annotation processing`.

#### How ?
The simple template engine, which is provided in this project, will push you to avoid writing code directly in `javax.annotation.processing.Filer` or
use libraries which wraps it in java code (like `javapoet`).

#### Comparison with existing alternatives 
 * [_JavaPoet_](https://github.com/square/javapoet)

 This library is a powerful solution for building Java classes as it provides a way to describe your future class. 
 The `main minus` of it is `overcoding` for creating small parts of code. [Here](https://github.com/square/javapoet#example) is an example of
 HelloWord app which is already overcoded.  
 
 * _Plain Java Processing API_

 This is standard solution provided by Java, where you should just printing out your class.
 `It's easy to write`, however if your processor creates hard part of logic, `it will not be readable`. 
 [Here](https://github.com/eugenp/tutorials/blob/master/annotations/annotation-processing/src/main/java/com/baeldung/annotation/processor/BuilderProcessor.java)
 is an example of implementing Builder pattern with a plain java.
 
 * **_This Project_**
 
 Using that solution, you can write a Java class which need be generated by processor 
 and then replace hardcoded types/names/etc by `variable` names, which value you will fill in processor.
 [Here](https://github.com/ArtemZip/processing-template-engine-example/blob/main/processor-example/src/main/java/com/github/artemzip/processing/example/ExampleBuilderProcessor.java)
 is an example of builder processor, which uses next template:
 
 ```java
package {{PACKAGE}};

{{USE:IMPORTS}}
import {{IMPORT}};
{{END}}

public class {{CLASS_NAME}}Builder {

    {{USE:FIELDS}}
    private {{TYPE}} {{NAME}};
    {{END}}

    public {{CLASS_NAME}}Builder(){}


    {{USE:FIELDS}}
    public {{CLASS_NAME}}Builder set{{^NAME}} ( {{TYPE}} {{NAME}} ) {
        this.{{NAME}} = {{NAME}};
        return this;
    }
    {{END}}

    public {{CLASS_NAME}} build() {
        {{CLASS_NAME}} obj = new {{CLASS_NAME}} ();

        {{USE:FIELDS}}
        obj.set{{^NAME}} ( {{NAME}} );
        {{END}}

        return obj;
    }
}
```
It's not a perfect style of templating, 
however `it reduces your code` in comparison with other techniques and `makes it easier to read`.
